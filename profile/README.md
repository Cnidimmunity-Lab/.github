## Welcome to the Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory Github

We are a collective of integrative biologists located at the [University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science](https://www.earth.miami.edu/) conducting world-class discovery research on the innate immune system in corals, sea anemones, and (the non-cnidarian) ctenophores. We investigate disease processes, environmental stress, symbiosis, wound healing, regeneration, and cellular mechanisms of immunity with the aim of enhancing our understanding of the fundamental processes of biological life in our oceans.

We believe in open source, transparent, and reproducible science. In this Github organization, you will find protocols associated with the following topics: 

* [Onboarding](https://github.com/Cnidimmunity-Lab/Onboarding)
* [Wet Lab](https://github.com/Cnidimmunity-Lab/Wet_Lab)
* [Dry Lab](https://github.com/Cnidimmunity-Lab/Dry_Lab)
* [Bioinformatics and Coding](https://github.com/Cnidimmunity-Lab/Bioinformatics_Coding)
